You take information from disparate sources—newspapers, websites, informants, ELINT, and the assets developed by Case Officers—and figure out what it means. In short, your job is the piecing together of unrelated knowledge, a dangerous endeavor in the world of Delta Green.

NAME: Intelligence Case Officer
DESCRIPTION: You recruit people to spy on their own countries for your agency, probably the CIA. Your job is to develop foreign intelligence sources (‘assets’), communicate with them, and keep them under control, productive, and alive. It’s a hard business because you must view everyone as a potential threat, liar, or tool to further your agenda. If your name came to the attention of Delta Green, congratulations; you are now someone else’s asset.
