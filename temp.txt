NAME: Soldier or Marine
DESCRIPTION: Governments will always need boots on the ground and steady hands holding rifles. When war begins, civilization gets out of the way. With the social contract void, unnatural things creep in at the edges. There’s a reason Delta Green began in the military

NAME: Criminal
DESCRIPTION: So much is illegal that there are broad economies of crime. This profile fits a hardened militant or a traditional “black collar” criminal: pimp, burglar, extortionist, or thug.

NAME: Firefighter
DESCRIPTION: Your job oscillates between the tedium of maintaining your gear, exhilaration when the alarm finally comes, and the work of investigating a scene after the smoke has cleared. If you’re involved with Delta Green, you clearly stumbled into something worse than a house fire.

NAME: Foreign Service Officer
DESCRIPTION: You travel to strange lands, meet interesting people, and try to get along with them. Odds are you work for the State Department, though USAID, the Commercial Service and the Foreign Agriculture Service also have FSOs. Either way, you’ve had every opportunity to learn exotic and deadly things; the kinds of things that qualify you for Delta Green clearance.

NAME: Intelligence Analyst
DESCRIPTION: In the FBI, NSA and CIA, there are those who gather information and those who decide what it means. You take information from disparate sources—newspapers, websites, informants, ELINT, and the assets developed by Case Officers—and figure out what it means. In short, your job is the piecing together of unrelated knowledge, a dangerous endeavor in the world of Delta Green.

NAME: Intelligence Case Officer
DESCRIPTION: You recruit people to spy on their own countries for your agency, probably the CIA. Your job is to develop foreign intelligence sources (‘assets’), communicate with them, and keep them under control, productive, and alive. It’s a hard business because you must view everyone as a potential threat, liar, or tool to further your agenda. If your name came to the attention of Delta Green, congratulations; you are now someone else’s asset.
